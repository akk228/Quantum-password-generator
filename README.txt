This is the genrator of passwords based on measuring quantum state.

Remarks:
    1) It can be run EXCLUSIVELY in Jupyter notebook
    2) Run a first cell to install quatum computing kit 'qiskit' if not installed already, then you can execute definitions of functions and run password generator.
    

However, this is one uses not a real quantum chip but a simulator of quantum device. It can be rewritten to be run aon a real quantum device very easily, but it takes eternity to reach your turn in the queue after job submission. And, this algorithms requires amount of jobs equal to the length of your password.
